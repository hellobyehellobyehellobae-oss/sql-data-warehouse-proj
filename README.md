# sql-data-warehouse-proj

# This project aimed to take raw, messy data and turn it into something a business can actually use to make decisions. 
# It covers everything from the building warehouse in  back-end layer to the analytical insights at the end.

# What I wanted to achieve: I used SQL Server to build a warehouse that brings together sales info from two different places: an ERP and a CRM system. Usually, this data is all over the place, so my goal was to get it into one clean, easy-to-use spot.


### Warehousing:

The Data: I started with two CSV files.

Cleaning: The data wasn't perfect, so I spent time fixing errors and making sure everything matched up before I started the analysis.

The Setup: I combined both sources into one simple model so that anyone (not just tech people) could run a query and get an answer.

Note: I focused on the most recent data for this project rather than tracking every single change over time.

### Analytics and Reporting:

Customer Behavior: Who is buying what?

Product Performance: Which items are the "stars" and which aren't selling?

Sales Trends: Are we doing better this month than last month?
